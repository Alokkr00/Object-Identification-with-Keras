# Object-Identification-with-Keras

Object Detection App is a machine learning application built with Django and Keras that performs real-time object detection. This project uses a pre-trained Keras model to identify objects in images uploaded through a web interface.

## Used 

# TensorFlow: For providing the framework for building and training the machine learning model.

# Django: For the web framework used to create the application.
# Keras: For high-level neural network API used in the project.
